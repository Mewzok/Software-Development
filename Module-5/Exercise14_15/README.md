The program must change the code that determines the number of sides that the current polygon has from 6 to 8, on line 41. It must change the inheritance from Pane to StackPane and import StackPane. It will need to rotate the current polygon, now made an octagon, by 22.5 degrees to get the flat end on top, resembling a stop sign. Text will need to be added and modified, made larger and colored white with no outline. The stack pane will automatically put it in the center, and so long as it is added after the octagon it will appear on top.
